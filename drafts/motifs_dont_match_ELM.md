# Motif - Domain Results Table: motif - viral protein - human domain interactions

## How I identify Domains likely to mediate interaction?  

I estimate this using empirical p-value for seing a domain a number of times.  
More specifically, what is the chance of randomly seeing any domain the observed number of times among all proteins that interact with a specific viral protein?



## Counts of domains that are likely to mediate interaction with a viral protein that has an instance of a potentially new motif

More precisely, these domains are overrepresented in proteins that interact with a specific viral proteins. In addition to saying this domains may be mediating interaction, this can be also interpreted is a way that viral proteins interact with proteins that have functions conferred by the domain (if an enriched domain is an ATPase domain, then the viral protein prefferentially interacts with ATPase-s).

The number of domain instances is shown per each domain:

## Motifs that don't match ELM

Each motif may be interacting with one of the many domains that were found enriched.

Motif_Dataset tells that sequences of interacting partners of ID-1 proteins were searched for motifs while the search space was restricted using ID-2 (example "interactors_of.ID-1.ID-2").  
The number of motif instances is shown per each motif:
