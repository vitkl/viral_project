## Setting up how many cores to use for analysis and fold-enrichment vs freqency


```r
# cores to use for multiprocessing: is the number of cores is small -> we are not on a cluster -> use all; if the number of cores is large -> we are on cluster -> use only 15 or 7 or 31 cores (n requested-1)
if(detectCores() <= 4) cores_to_use = detectCores() - 1
if(detectCores() > 4) cores_to_use = 31

# how many permutations?

I did Fisher test to evaluate if the domains that we find are enriched in domains known to interact with linear motifs (from ELM). I have picked some number of viral protein - human domain associations from the top (by p-value). Then I counted how many known domains we have found and did Fisher test. I decided to compare two statistic choices (frequency of a domain among interacting partners of a viral protein or Fisher test p-value) on how many of the known domains we tend to find. Finally, I was choosing different cutoffs (different number of top p-value pairs).

## As we include more proteins, the number of known domains we find increases and then levels off (probably because some of the known domains do not interact with viral proteins).


```r
plotEnrichment(enrichment, enrichmentBayes, enrichment_justfreq, enrichment_low_back, enrichment_low_deg, enrichment_low_deg_back,
               enrichmentRev, enrichmentMix,
               enrichmentFISHERodds, enrichmentFISHER_justodds,
               enrichmentFISHERpval, enrichmentFISHER_justpval, enrichmentFISHERoddsBig,
               random_domains = enrichmentRANDOM, 
               domains_known_mapped = domains_known_mapped, type = "count", plot_type = "l")
```

## As we include more proteins, the Fisher test odds ratio decreases (we add more stuff that is not known). Odds ratio measures how much more likely are we to find a domain using our procedure if it’s a known domain as compared to if it’s not a known domain.


```r
plotEnrichment(enrichment, enrichment_justfreq,
               enrichmentresJustFISHER, enrichmentresJustFISHER005,
               enrichmentresJustFISHER01, enrichmentresJustFISHER001,
               enrichmentBayes, enrichmentBayes2,
               random_domains = enrichmentRANDOM, 
               domains_known_mapped = domains_known_mapped, type = "odds_ratio", plot_type = "l")
```

## corresponding P-values from the Fisher test 


```r
plotEnrichment(enrichment, enrichment_justfreq,
               enrichmentresJustFISHER, enrichmentresJustFISHER005,
               enrichmentresJustFISHER01, enrichmentresJustFISHER001,
               enrichmentBayes, enrichmentBayes2,
               random_domains = enrichmentRANDOM, 
               domains_known_mapped = domains_known_mapped, type = "pval", plot_type = "l")
```

## How many viral proteins are known per each of the domain instances in top 200 protein-domain pairs?

70 human proteins with enriched domains have 5 or more viral interacting partners.  
14 human proteins with enriched domains have 10 or more viral interacting partners.  

### what are those domains? are they known ELM-interacting domains? which proteins they are in? which viral taxons they interact with?
