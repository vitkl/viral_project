_readable.tsv tables:

"Pattern" - SLiM pattern
"Human_recognition_domain_name" - self-evident
"Domain_p.value" - empirical p-value for domain-viral protein pair
"top_domain_support4motif_nq" - how many human instances of "Pattern" motif predicted using the same dataset (same Human_protein and Viral_protein) have the same "Human_recognition_domain" top-1 domain
"domain_support4motif_nq" - similar to "top_domain_support4motif_nq" but counts "Human_recognition_domain" domain with p<0.5 not just the top domain. This threshold is set using mBenchmarkMotifs.
"domain_support4motif_q" - similar to "domain_support4motif_nq" but counts domains predicted for other viral instances (rather than human)
"unique_position" - position of "Pattern" in "Human_protein" 
"Human_protein" - UniprotKB accession of human protein with domain
"in_ELM" - is a "Human_recognition_domain" known SLiM-binding domain?
"matching_known" - does "unique_position" SLiM match known
"human_instances" - list of human instances of "Pattern" motif predicted using the same dataset (same Human_protein and Viral_protein)
"Viral_protein_names" - protein name of a viral protein with motif recommended by Uniprot  
"Viral_entry_name" - Uniprot entry name of a viral protein with motif
"Human_protein_names" - protein name of a human protein with domain recommended by Uniprot     
"Human_entry_name" - Uniprot entry name of a human protein with domain   
"Human_recognition_domain" - InterPro domain ID
"Motif_Sig" - "Sig" motif p-value provided by QSLIMFinder
"Viral_protein" - UniprotKB accession of a viral protein with motif 
"Viral_gene_names" - gene name of "Viral_protein"
"Human_gene_names" - gene name of "Human_protein"

_network tables:
source - source node for Cytoscape
target - target node for Cytoscape
source_readable	- readable name of source
target_readable	- readable name of target
human_instances - list of human instances of "Pattern" motif predicted using the same dataset (same Human_protein and Viral_protein)
top_domain_support4motif_nq - how many human instances of "Pattern" motif predicted using the same dataset (same Human_protein and Viral_protein) have the same "Human_recognition_domain" top-1 domain
domain_support4motif_nq - similar to "top_domain_support4motif_nq" but counts "Human_recognition_domain" domain with p<0.5 not just the top domain. This threshold is set using mBenchmarkMotifs.
type_source	- type of source (used for color mapping)
type_target - type of target (used for color mapping)

_node_table tables:
node - nodes in source and target
node_readable - readable name of node
type - node type, motif, domain, viral protein, human protein
p_value	- either Motif_Sig or Domain_p.value for motifs or domains correspondingly. !! attention: import to Cytoscape as floating point
N_human_instances_bind_domain - shows both top: top_domain_support4motif_nq and all: domain_support4motif_nq. !! attention: import to Cytoscape as floating point
scale_by - scaling factor for domain and motif nodes, based on Motif_Sig and top_domain_support4motif_nq !! attention: import to Cytoscape as floating point
scale_by2 - alternative scaling factor !! attention: import to Cytoscape as floating point
