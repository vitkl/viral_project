## Setting up how many cores to use for analysis and fold-enrichment vs freqency

```{r}
# cores to use for multiprocessing: is the number of cores is small -> we are not on a cluster -> use all; if the number of cores is large -> we are on cluster -> use only 15 or 7 cores
if(detectCores() <= 4) cores_to_use = detectCores() - 1
if(detectCores() > 4) cores_to_use = 15

# Choose statistic for permutations:
# frequency in a set (of human interacting partners of viral protein) or fold_enrichment? frequency is used if TRUE 
frequency = TRUE
# Do I remove proteins with missing domains before p-value calculation and calculate qvalue (won't work if there are a lot of zeros)?
remove_zeros = FALSE
calculate_qval = remove_zeros
# how many permutations?

## Null hypothesis description

## How often do we observe specific fold enrichment value among interactors of a viral protein

### Summary:
- **statistic:** frequency of a domain among interacting partners of viral protein  
- **data:** viral protein - human protein interactions; human protein - human domain interactions  
- **inference method:** permutations along viral protein - human protein interface  
- **results plotted:** permutation-derived distribution of a statistic; pvalue distribution; pvalue vs statistic  
- **proteins with missing domains:** inlcude for permutations, inlcude in permutation-derived distribution before calculating p-value  

#### Probability of actual fold enrichment under the NULL distribution: How often specific domain fold enrichment among interactors of a specific viral protein (attribute of a viral_protein-human_domain pair) is observed as compared to any domain fold enrichment among interactors of that viral protein (attribute of a viral_protein, NULL distribution), the latter is derived from permutation mimicking as if viral protein was binding to a different set of human proteins   

Using fold enrichent as a statistic accounts for domain frequency in the background distribution. Background distribution of domain frequency in based on all human proteins with known PPI.   

Luckily, the network that we have is a bipartite undirected network (viral proteins - human proteins or human proteins - human domains). That means that we can shuffle interactions (links, edges) on the interface between viral and human proteins which is algorithmically quite fast even for large networks as compared to randomising conventional unipartite undirected networks.  

One of the ways to describe the problem of finding domains that are likely to mediate interaction of human proteins with viral proteins is by drawing a network which has 3 types of elements: viral proteins (V1, V2, V3), human proteins (H1-10) and human domains (D1-10).
```{r f1, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/net_start.jpg")
```


First, we compute the fraction of human interacting partners of V2 that contain domain D6. Then, we compute the fold enrichment by dividing this fraction by the domain frequency among all proteins in the network. **Alternatively, we use the domain frequency as a statistic**
```{r f2, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/net_start_calc.jpg")
```

Next, we permute which human proteins interact with V1, V2 and V3, keeping the number of interaction per both viral and human proteins as well as number of edges (interactions) constant
```{r f4, out.width = "450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/net_scram.jpg")
```

Finally, we repeat this procedure 1000-5000 times which gives us the probability of specific human domain - specific viral protein co-occurence if the domain and the protein were unrelated.  

We calculate this by comparing real fold enrichment value to the distribution of fold enrichment of randomly associated domains. For each human domain-viral protein value we calculate the fraction of the (random, NULL) distribution that is as high or higher than the real value.  

```{r f6, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/net_start_fraq.jpg")
```
```{r f7, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/net_scram_fraq.jpg")
```


## Load network 

Network is saved by "Map_domains_to_network.Rmd" script which describes how the network and domain data were obtained.

```{r load}
viral_human_net_w_domains_d = fread("./processed_data_files/viral_human_net_w_domains", sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = F)

# generate minimal information tables
viral_human_net = unique(viral_human_net_w_domains_d[,.(IDs_interactor_viral, IDs_interactor_human, IDs_interactor_viral_degree)])

domains_proteins = unique(viral_human_net_w_domains_d[,.(IDs_interactor_human, IDs_domain_human, domain_frequency)])

viral_human_net_w_domains = unique(viral_human_net_w_domains_d[,.(IDs_interactor_viral, IDs_interactor_human, IDs_domain_human, domain_frequency_per_IDs_interactor_viral, fold_enrichment)])

# remove viral proteins with no corresponding human domains from this version of the data: we can't calculate the probability of viral protein - human domain interaction if there isn't any. However, permutations of viral-human interaction network are performed on all interactions including the one's when human partner doesn't have any domains, viral_human_net contains all interactions.
viral_human_net_w_domains = viral_human_net_w_domains[IDs_domain_human != "",]
```
