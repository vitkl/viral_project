## Empirical p-value for seing a domain a number of times
### What is the chance of randomly seeing any domain the observed number of times among all proteins that interact with a specific viral protein


```r
fdr_motifs = 1
fdr_pval_thresh = 1
X = printMotifDomainTable(res_count, doman_viral_pairs = doman_viral_pairs, motifs = motifs, destfile = "./domains_fdr_corrected_only_with_significant_motifs_empirical_p_value.tsv",

```

## Which motifs don't match ELM


```r
